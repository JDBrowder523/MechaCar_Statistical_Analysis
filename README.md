 - Summary statistics were generated using RStudio to see which factors provided a non-random variance on miles per gallon(mpg).  The two factors that provided statistically significant non-random variance are vehicle length and ground clearance.  These factors had p-values of 2.6e-12 and 5.21e-8, respectively, which is less than the threshold of 0.05. 

 - The slop of the regression line is 5.35e-11.  This is considered to be 0 slope.

 - This linear regression model does predict the mpg of the MechaCar effectively due to the r^2 value of .7149. Effectively, the linear regression model is 71.49% accurate.
